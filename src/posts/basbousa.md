## Step 1 - Making the syrup

- In a saucepan, combine $1 \frac{1}{2}$ cups of sugar with 1 cup of water.
- Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
- _(optional)_ add a splash oh lemon juice and/or rose/orange blossom water.
- Remove from heat and let cool completely.

## Step 2 - Prep the cake batter

- In a bowl, first mix the dry ingredients:
  - 2 cups of semolina flour
  - 1 cup shredded desiccated/shredded coconut (optional but not really)
  - $\frac{3}{4}$ cups of sugar
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - A pinch of salt

- Then mix in the wet ingredients:
  - $\frac{1}{2}$ melted butter (or ghee)
  - 1 cup of plain yogurt (or 1 cup of milk + 1 Tbsp of vinegar)
- Texture should be thick and spoonable, not runny.
- Let batter rest 10-15 minutes so the semolina absorbs moisture.

## Step 3 - Bake

- Butter the bottom of a 9in x 13in pan.
- Spread the batter evenly and level the top.
- Score the batter into squares or diamonds.
- Place an almond or a hazelnut on each scored section.
- Bake in a preheated 350&deg;F oven for 30-40 minutes.

## Step 4 - Adding the syrup

- As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, evenly pour the syrup over the cake.
- Let it soak for ~30 minutes (or as long as you can bare) before serving.

Enjoy!
