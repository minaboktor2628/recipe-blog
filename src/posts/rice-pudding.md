## Instructions

- Add the following to a big pot:
  - 1 cup of rice - traditionally Egyptian short grain rice, but any kind will work (rinse until clear!)
  - $1\frac{1}{2}-2$ cups of water
- Let simmer on medium-high heat for around 10 minutes. Do not let the pot get dry.
- Once your rice reaches a porridge-like consistency, turn the heat down to medium. High heat make burn the milk.
- Start slowly adding in 6-8 cups of milk (more milk will make the final texture looser)
- Add in a pinch of salt and a splash of vanilla.
- Add $\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}$ cups of sugar and stir.
- Let simmer for ~30 minutes. You have to trust the process- but it will eventually thicken up!
- Once thickened, pour into individual sized serving containers and let cool in the fridge.
- Top with shredded coconut, golden raisins, and almonds or hazelnuts (any nuts will work great!)

Enjoy!
